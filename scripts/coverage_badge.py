"""Write the shields.io endpoint document behind the README's coverage badge.

usage: coverage_badge.py <coverage.py JSON report> <coverage.json to write>

The input is what `coverage json` writes; the figure is its statement
coverage, as the rest of the passmcp family reports. The output is the
endpoint schema shields.io reads, in the family's colour bands:
brightgreen from 90, green from 85 (the gate), yellow from 70, red below.
The percentage is truncated, not rounded, so 84.96% reads 84.9% and the
badge never shows the gate as met when it is not.
